        "text": "Welcome to Comp 611: Advanced Data Structures and Programming \n\nThis course continues the objected-oriented approach to software construction and focuses on non-linear data structures and algorithms in Computer Science. We will discuss advanced object-oriented techniques, algorithm efficiency, and data structures. To support the concepts and principles we’ll be discussing, you will design, code, test, debug, and document programs using the Java programming language. Topics include recursion, non-linear data structures (sets, maps, balanced binary search trees, heaps, hashing and hash tables, and graphs) and efficient sorting algorithms. \n\nTo make sure we get started on the right foot, there are a number of administrative issues I would like to cover. \n\nCanvas \n\nWe will not be using Canvas for anything but the gradebook this semester. All communication should be in Ed. I will not respond to messages in Canvas.  \n\nHybrid Sessions \n\nThis semester the course is being run as a hybrid course. That means the online and face-to-face sections are being run at the same time. We will be meeting on Thursdays from 6:30-8:00 in the classroom, and the online students will be able to attend the weekly sessions using Zoom.  \n\nOffice Hours \n\nI will be available on Zoom from 10-11AM on Sundays to answer any questions that you have. You can use this link to join: https://franklin.zoom.us/j/3876174304 \n\nSyllabus \n\nPlease read the course syllabus and ask me if anything is not clear to you. I would like to emphasize a few of the items outlined in the syllabus: \n\nSubmission \u0026 Return Policy \n\nPlease note that assignments must be submitted by 11:59pm ET on the due date posted on the schedule. There is a late penalty of 10% per day up to three days late, and after that you will receive a grade of zero. \n\nAcademic Integrity \n\nCheating of any kind will not be tolerated in the course. You are expected to write, debug, and test your own code. In addition, all papers that you turn in should be in your own words and use proper APA citation of sources used. If you have any questions regarding academic integrity, please ask me. \n\nCourse Communications \n\nWe will be using Edstem for communication in this course. Please post questions to edstem, rather than emailing them to me. I receive a lot of email, and you will get much faster responses via edstem. If the question includes portions of your code, or only applies to you, then you can post it as private, and only I will be able to see it. \n\nTechnical Difficulties \n\nIf you are experiencing technical difficulties in the course (you never received your course CD, you cannot access the web site, you cannot access your Einstein account, etc.) please call the Help Desk for assistance (614-341-6222). You can also email them at helpdesk@franklin.edu. \n\nSlides \n\nThe slides I will be using during the Meet sessions are available here: https://franklinu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/timothy_kington_franklin_edu/Esj0pWnVJ59PqLCGHG_bMc8BpqqdsucixPwpU0Toy4yXLg?e=X7A1BF \n\nSoftware Setup \n\nYou will need to create a GitHub account and respond to this post with your username to get access to the instructions and starter code for the project assignments this semester.

In 2018, I began my academic journey at The Ohio State University, where I had many great experiences, including serving as the president of a student organization and being a member of the executive board for another. I lived on campus for six years, three of which I spent as a Resident Advisor. I graduated with my B.S. in Psychology in December 2023 and earned my B.S. in Computer Science \u0026 Engineering this past May.\n\nI currently live in Columbus, OH. Moving off campus and transitioning away from that chapter of my life has been challenging, and I’m working to find a new routine and purpose. I knew I couldn’t stay on campus as an RA with a free room and dining hall access forever, so I recognized the need to find my own place and secure a full-time job to support myself.\n\nI never imagined pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, let alone while working full-time—but here we are. I decided in June to pursue my Master’s, in part because the sudden shift from academia to the workplace was a real shock, and I found that I actually missed the routine of taking classes. This is somewhat comical because I used to tell myself that I could finally sleep and rest once I completed my dual degrees. Essentially, I lied to my future self, and here we are. Now, I find myself saying the same thing—I can rest once I’ve completed my master’s degree.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and visiting thrift stores to buy well-loved furniture, which I then remodel and “flip” into something beautiful.\n\nI am currently working at the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) as a Software Development Specialist in the Office of Information Services. My primary focus is maintaining the OhioMHAS website, which Ohioans interact with every day.\n\nFront-end software development, and UX are my passions.\n\nFind me on LinkedIn :)",

I knew I couldn’t stay on campus as an RA with a free room and dining hall access forever, so I recognized the need to find my own place and secure a full-time job to support myself.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI never imagined pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, let alone while working full-time—but here we are. I decided in June to pursue my Master’s, in part because the sudden shift from academia to the workplace was a real shock, and I found that I actually missed the routine of taking classes. This is somewhat comical because I used to tell myself that I could finally sleep and rest once I completed my dual degrees. Essentially, I lied to my future self, and here we are. Now, I find myself saying the same thing—I can rest once I’ve completed my master’s degree.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIn my spare time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and visiting thrift stores to buy well-loved furniture, which I then remodel and “flip” into something beautiful.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI am currently working at the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) as a Software Development Specialist in the Office of Information Services. My primary focus is maintaining the OhioMHAS website, which Ohioans interact with every day.\u003cbreak/\u003e\u003cbreak/\u003eFront-end software development, and UX are my passions.\u003cbreak/\u003e\u003cbreak/\u003eFind me on LinkedIn :)\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

All of my tests pass but when I submit to Ed, many of them are failing.  The \"add\" one is particularly puzzling because it is the same as the \"subtract\", \"multiply\", etc.  But then all of the comparisons are failing.  Please see my tests and how I have verified them on my side.  I am just not sure what your program is looking for when it tests it in \"Ed\".\n\nI am a little frustrated and have spent a lot of time trying to figure out why the Ed tests are failing.  I feel like I am shooting in the dark.  Normally I would step through a debugger to see what might be wrong or use print statements but Ed just tells me the expected values and what was returned.\n\nWhat are my options at the point?  I looked and it appears tutors are not available for this 611 class.  I can come to the Sunday appointment you have available but I know it is only an hour so I am not sure how helpful that will be.  If I cannot get these to pass, does this just mean I don't get those points?  That would be a really rough way to start.\n\nSincerely, \n\nTim H\n\n",

        "text": "A question I would have in Adapter Patterns would be when would it not be a good idea to use these patterns? Is this the industry standard when running into these interface issues?\n\nConsidering the disadvantages of Adapter patterns, where should we not use adapter patterns and what can be the replacement of this?\n\nAre there any disadvantages of the adapter pattern past increased complexity and more overhead?\n\nNo, and those aren't worth worrying about.  If you're in a situation where you need an adapter, use it.\n\nI am still confused about what JDK classes exactly are.\n\nThose are classes like ArrayList that come with your Java distribution.\n\nHowever, we do have a lot of collection interfaces, such as TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, LinkedList etc. provided by java. How do we proceed to choose perfect interface when implementing the collection. Any suggestions or tips?\n\nThat's kind of the point of the whole course.\n\nWhile I found the discussion of Adapter design patterns enlightening, one point that still confuses me is the scalability of this pattern, specifically how it might introduce performance overhead or complexity in systems with many concrete implementations.\n\nI've never seen a real example with lots of implementations.  Three is the max I've run into in the real world.\n\nWhat other reasons would hashCode method be used in the real world?\n\nIt's used a lot in maps, as we saw after you asked this :)\n\nFor someone who does not have a Computer Sciences background, what could I put on my resume that would reflect what I’ve learned in pass and future classes a Franklin?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.  Are you not pursuing a degree?\n\nMy question for the week is where would you recommend going to learn some of the source code for the JDK classes?\n\nYou can find the source code in src.zip in the JDK on your machine.\n\nIf there are any other \"contracts\" that developers will have to store in their back-pockets of knowledge for working with anything else, and what would be the best way to remember the little tricks to them (such as which methods to override, if any)?\n\nhashCode() and equals() is the big one.  That comes up a lot.  The only other one I can think of off the top of my head is the Comparable interface.  That shows up fairly often, too.\n\nHow common is it to see overrides of custom hashCode() and equals() methods in terms of custom classes in the computer science field?\n\nExtremely common.\n\nI am curious if there are opportunities you know of where I could work part time with companies with the skills I have learned in the classes here at Franklin? Since I have summers off (June and July completely) with sporadic breaks throughout the year, are there part-time opportunities that are worth it?\n\nAny experience is worth it.  Tanium is interviewing interns for next summer right now.  The pay is great - $60/hour - but that also means the interviews are very competitive.  Even if you don't expect to get the position, interviewing practice is useful.\n\nHow important is it to understand and be able to use Adapter patterns/ is it something that is used a lot in the workplace?\n\nIt's pretty important.  Not because it's used all the time, but because if you understand the concepts behind it, then it's easy to understand the pattern, and the concepts behind it are used all the time.\n\nWhat key factors/what is the best practice when deciding when it is appropriate to alter existing code or create an adapter class?\n\nYou have to think about it.\n\nWhere would we be in 5 years from now?\n\nIf I knew, I would be investing accordingly, not telling everybody :)\n\nWhy is there a need to be this much uncertainty and growth of a technology?\n\nChange is the only constant.\n\nWhat is a real-world example of the Decorator pattern that would be a time that it would be the best pattern choice?\n\nThe Java io libraries are a great example.  Classes like BufferedOutputStream, DataOutputStream, ZipOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream, etc.\n\nWhat surprised me is that I have been using these structures for many years in large enterprise applications and most of the time, if not all the time, the attention that is given when choosing one is not the efficiency of accessing the contents of the structure?  Usually, the most important consideration is if the structure has the methods I need to easily work with the object such as add, remove, etc.\n\nWell, they all have the methods they need to be useful.  This is the main reason software is slow.\n\nOne thing that I am still confused about is how to calculate the “Big O” notation of more inefficient data structures. The simple ones make sense to me, such as O(n) and O(1). The more inefficient are confusing to me as to how to easily determine which notation should be applied. Do you have any recommended readings, tips, or resources that would help me understand this better?\n\nI don't, but we'll be talking about this almost every week.\n\nI wonder how to effectively identify when a specific design pattern is most beneficial during the development lifecycle?\n\nYour goal shouldn't be to use patterns, it's to solve problems.  If the problem you have can be best solved by a pattern, then use it.\n\nIn what scenarios would you recommend using sets over other data structures, such as lists or maps, in software development?\n\nThey are different things.  I would use a set when I want to represent a set of objects.",

        "text": "In my \"basic\" understanding, it seems best to use Hashmaps with separate chaining. What am I missing that would make Hashmaps with linear probing a better solution?\n\nIf you're extremely focused on performance, it's better to have you data in an array than to have to follow a reference to get to it.  That's where open addressing is better.  If you really want the best performance, you wouldn't use linear probing, though.  You might use quadratic probing, or maybe cuckoo hashing.\n\nHow might we dynamically resize a hash table using linear probing without performance degradation, particularly when dealing with large data sets?\n\nWhat effects does the rehashing and resizing process have on the data's overall efficiency in these situations?\n\nIt's always going to cost O(n) time to resize the table.  The key is to not do it too often.  If you at least double the table size each time, then when you average the cost of resizing over all of the inserts, it's still O(1).  Arraylists do exactly the same thing.\n\nI’m still unclear on how tombstones complicate the removal process in linear probing. Are there alternative approaches to handle deletions without affecting performance?\n\nI said they complicate the process, not that they hurt performance.  Deletion is O(1).\n\nHow could someone in Cybersecurity benefit from learning computer science?\n\nThe more you know, the better.  We have security engineers at Tanium that are paid very well.  They can write code, and they know how to go through the code the rest of the engineers write and try to find vulnerabilities.\n\nMy question for the week is where would be a good resource for learning the intricacies of IDEs and github?\n\nThe github documentation is very good.\n\nFor git, I recommend Pro Git.  The internals chapter is very much worth reading. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain\n\nThis is also pretty great: https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US\n\nWould we be able to use scrap paper for our tests?\n\nYes.\n\nin most cases, is it suitable or sufficient to use a language-specific hash table implementation (like Java's HashMap class) vs. a custom implementation?\n\nYes, you're usually going to be fine with your language libraries.  Even when you're not, there's often a 3rd-party library you can buy that will get you what you need.  abseil is an excellent one for C++, for example.\n\nAs we dive in deeper into our content, I am wondering how much of these skills are used on a regular basis in the industry? In other words, how diverse are your problem solving strategies in the industry? Is there a specific subset of coding knowledge that gets utilized more heavily on a daily basis? I am trying to understand how fluid all of these concepts would need to be in the industry.\n\nThe great thing about this course is that none of the material changes.  This is all fundamental Computer Science, and has been the same for fifty years.  Languages will come and go, but this is the same in any language.\n\nAs for problem solving strategies, that's the interesting part of the job, and why it pays so well.  I come up with a new approach every time I solve an interesting problem.\n\nI tried to understand hashcode() from sources, but I couldn't get what is the exact usage of the hashcode method.\n\nIs it clear now that you've seen it used in class?\n\nSomething I have been missing is to decide when to use specific data structure. when I am developing for work, instantly, ArrayList and hashmap comes into my mind. instead, I should weigh in and pick the most suitable data structure for that particular need. it is one of the reason i am taking this masters program for. The question I have on DSA is how to know which data structure to use for particular use-case?\n\nYou have to use your noodle.  If this was formulaic, we would get a robot to do it.\n\nCould you clarify under what circumstances quadratic probing might result in an infinite loop, and what practical ways we can mitigate or prevent this issue in practice?\n\nIf the size of your table is right (wrong), then you'll keep checking the same slots as you use bigger and bigger squares.  It turns out you only see half of the table slots in this situation.  One way to handle it is to resize the table if the # of slots you've looked at is greater than the size of the table.  You probably should resize well before that for performance reasons.\n\nWhen would you actually implement a TreeMap over a HashMap?\n\nWhen you want your keys to be in sorted order.\n\nMy question is related more towards the Computer Science field as a whole, I feel like on the internet many entry level jobs are more difficult to get than in the past, with a lot of people saying that entry level no longer exists. Do you think that the more Junior roles are obsolete and if so what will be long term impacts of this in the future if any?\n\nA lot of places only want people with experience, so it can be hard to find that first job.  Take anything you can find to get some experience, and then things get much easier.\n\nIt's impossible for entry-level roles to disappear completely, right?  Eventually we would run out of developers.\n\nOne thing that is a question to me is how this all works in a language such as JavaScript compared to Java? Much of coding in my career has been divided between these 2 languages and I wonder how these concepts affect JavaScript storage structures. Could one run into similar problems you do in Java caused by a high load factor if you were using it heavily in an AWS Lambda function using JavaScript?\n\nEverything we're doing in this course works the same way in every language.  There will be small differences.  For example, in JS, there's not a well-defined way of comparing objects or getting a hash code from them, so if you want to use a hash table, you'll have to define those things for your objects.  IMO, that's by far the most annoying thing about JS.\n\nHow can we decide on the optimal collision resolution approach when developing systems that balance memory efficiency and speed?\n\nGenerally, you won't.  You'll use whatever HashTable implementation comes with your language, and it will be good enough.  Java uses chaining, but it turns the linked list in a bucket into a BST if it winds up with more than 16(?) entries.",

        "text": "Is there a \"magic\" number that recursion always makes sense over iteration? If a method needs to run a handful of times would you personally use iteration or recursion?\n\nMy question for the week is in what areas is recursion used in high end software development that a for or while loop would not be better?\n\nWhat are some cases where recursion works better than iteration?\n\nDoes the efficiency of recursive solutions over iterative solutions depend on certain scenarios or problem-solving types, or is it mostly a matter of preference and understanding among programmers?\n\nIn real-world projects, how do developers determine when to choose recursion over iteration?\n\nIt's not about how many times it runs.  It's more about the structure of the problem.  Try writing a tree traversal without recursion, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nWhen is recursion the optimal solution, and when might an iterative approach be more efficient in terms of time and space complexity?\n\nBoth approaches will have the same time complexity.  You may have to think about stack space when you take the recursive approach - sometimes you can run out if you have a lot of recursive calls.\n\nHow to determine the most efficient base case, especially when it comes to more complex problems like tiling or generating possible character strings?  How to identify the best points to divide a problem and when to combine solutions effectively? Is there a general rule for when recursion or a divide-and-conquer approach should be favored over iterative techniques, especially with concerns around memory overhead and stack limitations in recursive methods?\n\nYou should think real hard.  This is what we get paid for.\n\nCould memorization or dynamic programming provide a better balance between efficiency and clarity in such cases?\n\nIt's memoization, and it can be used in either case.  Dynamic programming can be better in some cases, and that's when we use it :)\n\nWhat type of assignments would someone in an entry level position be tasked to do?\n\nIt's a very wide range.  Sometimes it's trivial grunt work to start with, and sometimes they let you dive right in.  My interns this summer wrote code that collected data about problems in our customer environments, wrote an API to allow that data to be retrieved, and then wrote a front-end in React to display the data.\n\nWould you happen to be able to explain a time in which you've found that recursion was needed for a task in your career?\n\nI've used it lots of times when dealing with tree structures.  I did a lot of work in industrial control, and control networks are modeled as a tree or graph, so recursion is the most natural way to handle them.\n\nAfter being in the computer science profession for a while, do you find it normal to doubt your abilities (or feel imposter syndrome) when encountering a difficult problem that doesn't click after several attempts?\n\nI've only had it bad once, when I started working at Fog Creek/Glitch.  That was after almost 20 years of experience.  Fog Creek had such a reputation for hiring great engineers, and I think that's what caused it.  You may not have heard of them, but you know their products - they created and spun off Stack Overflow and Trello.  For me it had nothing to do with getting stuck on a problem.  I was writing lots of code, and getting lots of positive feedback from my manager, but for the first six months there, I just had a nagging feeling that I wasn't good enough.\n\nThree weeks in and I feel like our homework problems are fair and to the point. I have liked working on them. I am wondering if our exam questions will be similar in style?\n\nYes, they'll be the same style, but a little easier.\n\nHow important is it to learn Git in the workplace and is it a common tool used?\n\nYes.  It's probably the most widely used tool in software companies.  You need to learn it.\n\nIn complex recursive algorithms, how do we define and validate the base case to ensure proper termination and avoid infinite recursion? Can you share an example where determining the appropriate case was particularly challenging?\n\nThis is another one where you have to think hard.  I don't think I've had one where thinking of the base case was too hard, but one of the more interesting recursive things I've done was to write code that would draw a binary tree on the screen.  This was in DOS, so you were drawing the individual pixels in your code.  I did it by recursively breaking the screen down into smaller and smaller rectangles.\n\nCan you recommend reading material or additional resources on Big O notion. I have difficulty determining when the O(n) is log_n or n log_n. \n\nI don't have any good ones, really.  Usually, a log n term comes from splitting something in half repeatedly until you wind up with a single element.\n\nIn your experience, how many companies that build software would you estimate are significantly behind when it comes to their technical debt? E.g., still running their backend software on really old versions of Java. I'm curious about any thoughts you have about maintaining legacy software and keeping it current.\n\nTons of companies do this.  Running on old versions of Java is less of a problem than having mountains of unmaintainable legacy code, though.  Whenever I've been in charge of a team, we've been on the latest versions of our language.",

If you delete the root item of a tree, would GC delete the entire tree?\n\nYes, as long as no other variable was holding a reference to one of the nodes.  Since nothing was pointing to the root, that object would be marked as dead.  References from a dead object don't keep other objects alive, so its children would be marked as dead, etc.\n\nIs there any applications in the job world for tech industry in software engineering, apart from social media companies, especially for a bank, for a graph theory or a tree data structure?\n\nThere are tons.  One thing a bank might do is track the flow of money from one account to another to look for money laundering.  That's a graph problem.\n\nWhat are real-world scenarios where developers face challenges in optimizing performance of tree structures and their balancing?\n\nAre there efficient algorithms or practices to maintain balance without resorting to self-balancing trees like AVL or Red-Black trees?\n\nWhat's wrong with those?  They solve the problem.\n\nIn 10 years, what changes do you see happening in the industry, if any?\n\nIf I knew, I would be placing my bets, not telling you about it :)\n\nThe biggest and most obvious thing is I think AI gets integrated into the development workflow everywhere.\n\nMy question for the week, is what would be some use cases where we would want to use a tree over another data structure such as a linked list or a hasmap?\n\nThose three all do different things.\n\nCan tags from previous weeks overwrite current tags, or do the higher weeks' tags take precedence?\n\nYou don't need to worry about deleting old tags.  You can have as many as you want in a repo, and my updater looks for the highest numbered assignment you're asking for.\n\nIs there anything in place to prevent accidentally tagging future week's project parts?\n\nNo, if you ask for part 10 right now, you'll get it, but all the earlier assignments will be locked for you.\n\nDo you have brief thoughts or advice on navigating the current job market in terms of landing a computer science job post-graduation?\n\nTake whatever you can get to get some experience on your resume.  Practice coding in an interview-like situtation.\n\nAre there patterns for time complexities the more you interact with finding them?\n\nYes :)\n\nAre there patterns for discovering the time complexity with our new data structures, or do they require a greater understanding what things get processed and how many times they get processed?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.  You need to understand what the code is doing to find the time complexity.\n\nHow important are Binary Trees/Binary search trees and how often are they used in the workplace?\n\nThey're used pretty often.  TreeSet and TreeMap are BSTs.\n\nSome real-world applications of BSTs?\n\nModifying a list while keeping it sorted.\n\nIn class can you show us the recursive version of 'valuesnLevelOrder()'. In class can you show us the recursive version of 'valuesnLevelOrder()'?\n\nHere's one way (I wrote this here, so it may not really work):\n\nvoid valuesHelper(int level, Map\u003cInteger, List\u003cInteger\u003e\u003e valuesByLevel) {\n  List\u003cInteger\u003e list = valuesByLevel.computeIfAbsent(level, (k)-\u003enew ArrayList\u003c\u003e());\n  list.add(data);\n  \n  if (left != null) {\n    left.valuesHelper(level + 1, valuesByLevel);\n  }\n  if (right != null) {\n    right.valuesHelper(level + 1, valuesByLevel);\n  }\n}\n\nWhen that method finishes, you can go through valuesByLevel and print everything out. \n\nIs there a data structure that can be inserted and removed using index and searched using Binary search Pattern?\n\nThis is pretty much what a skiplist is.\n\nWhich traversal type is optimal for different real-world uses (e.g., copying an entire directory)?\n\nIt depends on how your filesystem works.\n\nWould there be an advantage to aggressively balancing a search tree to always be complete, if this were possible?\n\nYou don't want to take it quite that far - it wouldn't be efficient.\n\nWhy are binary search trees not always balanced since balance would speed up searches? Does it depend on the order of data insertion, or are there specific algorithms needed to balance them, or does it depend on the level of expertise of the programmer?\n\nIn practice, they are.  TreeSet and TreeMap are red-black trees.  We'll learn about those in a couple of weeks.\n\nWhat is a common way to use a binary tree for systems that interact with a database?\n\nI don't think I've ever seen that.\n\nHow may the singleton pattern be implemented efficiently to guarantee thread safety without sacrificing performance?\n\nThe easiest way is to just create the object at startup before you spin off multiple threads.  That's how I always do it.  There are other ways, too: https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/114elwi/which_singleton_implementations_are_threadsafe/\n\n",

        "text": "Is the Vistor pattern common/basic? Meaning that if we are doing a small project that may grow, should we start our design with the visitor pattern or just implement it as needed?\n\nIt should be used a lot more than it is.  I've basically never seen it in the wild unless I put it there myself, but I've seen lots of places it should have been used.  You wouldn't put it in a project unless you were going to be doing a bunch of traversal work that needed it.\n\nDo we have any use of vector in the current scenarios in the industry since it is a legacy class of Collections framework?\n\nVector is functionally the same as ArrayList.  The difference is that Vector is thread-safe.  If multiple threads were using a list, you might use a Vector.\n\nI was particularly surprised at how challenging it was to manage paths dynamically during traversal, especially when backtracking in the postVisit phase to maintain correct paths. One area I still find confusing is efficiently managing context-specific paths without excessive state management in more complex trees. In situations where the visitor needs to maintain deep context, is there a recommended way to simplify the visitor’s state?\n\nNot in general, no.  You would have to think about the problem you're solving.\n\nShould I memorize every design pattern?\n\nAll of the ones we're covering are pretty important, so you should understand them.  I wouldn't go find a list online and try to memorize everything.  It might be worth memorizing what they're for so that you know to go learn one when it solves a problem you have.\n\nMy question for the week is where might we want to consider using a switch statement over a visitor pattern?\n\nThere are cases where a simple switch on the type of an object is good enough.  To get a feel for this, look at the code that turned your AST back into java in the solution to part 3.  If you wanted to write the CompileVisitor code that way, you would have to duplicate that whole structure.  Is that worth it?  Certainly not.  If you only had a simple tree of binary expressions, maybe it's not worth using the pattern.\n\nI recall what you stated in class - that some might argue that the visitor pattern is dead. However, after experiencing just a few use cases for this pattern, I firmly believe it is both flexible and powerful.\n\nI've seen several people saying you can replace it with a switch, but try it for the compile visitor, and I think you'll change your mind.\n\nIn a calculator like a TI-84, what is the structure of the calculations that are entered into it?  Is the calculator actually computing in the style we discussed in class?\n\nI'm not sure how that actually works.  With HP calculators that use postfix notation, they're using a stack exactly like we do in the VM.\n\nMy question would be what would a good example of using instanceof in your code be?\n\nThere really aren't a lot of good ways to use it.  One would be when reading from an ObjectInputStream if you wanted to give a good error message:\n\nObject obj = in.readObject();\nif (!(obj instanceof Student)) {\n  Logging.error(\"Expected a Student object, but got \" + obj);\n}\nStudent s = (Student)obj;\n\nEven that is a bit contrived, though.  If your file format is wrong, users don't care about the details.  You really just want a try/catch around the whole thing, and to say something like \"file format not recognized\".\n\nWhat are the potential limitations of using the composite pattern with expression trees?\n\nI haven't run into any.\n\nHow is visitor pattern different than polymorphism and inheritence of Object Oriented Programming?  And what are extra benefits do we get by using visitor pattern than using polymorphism?\n\nThis is like saying \"How is a building different from a brick?\"\n\nWhen do you choose the Visitor pattern over alternatives like double dispatch in cases with complex polymorphic behaviors?\n\nVisitor is simulating double dispatch because Java doesn't natively support double dispatch.  If it's built into your language, you wouldn't need the pattern.  The only language I know that has it off the top of my head is Smalltalk, and nobody uses that :)\n\nHow well does this pattern perform in environments where speed is crucial?  Does the overhead of separate visitor classes impact performance in real-time applications?\n\nIt does just fine.  What makes you think having more classes hurts performance? Polymorphism is a fundamental part of Java, and that's what the visitor uses to get its job done.  If you're writing Java and avoiding polymorphism because of the performance hit (which is microscopic), you're in the wrong language.\n\nWhat are the trade-offs of using the Visitor pattern in real-world software engineering?\n\nI don't see any.  I use it when it makes the code cleaner.\n\nDo you still do an end-of-class get together?\n\nYes, we usually go out to dinner the last week of class.\n\nOne thing that confused me was a design decision that was made in the VM assignment. The convertToStore method was placed in the LocalLocalOp class instead of outside in the visitor. I would have thought that method were a concern of the visitor and not LoadLocalOp given that the visitor is the class whose logic created the problem. My question this week is why we chose to convert it to store in that location?\n\nThat's because we have more operations coming that will need to be converted to stores.  If we put it in the opcode classes, then we can handle them all in the same way.\n\nAnother question is where you have used AI thus far in your career?\n\nI haven't used it much, but I use Codeium at work and it saves me some typing occasionally.\n\nWhat are the best practices for balancing design pattern implementation with system performance, especially in high-load scenarios?\n\nIt seems that I may have given the impression that design patterns hurt performance.  They don't.",

And what are extra benefits do we get by using visitor pattern than using polymorphism?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThis is like saying \"How is a building different from a brick?\"\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhen do you choose the Visitor pattern over alternatives like double dispatch in cases with complex polymorphic behaviors?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eVisitor is simulating double dispatch because Java doesn't natively support double dispatch.  If it's built into your language, you wouldn't need the pattern.  The only language I know that has it off the top of my head is Smalltalk, and nobody uses that :)\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eHow well does this pattern perform in environments where speed is crucial?  Does the overhead of separate visitor classes impact performance in real-time applications?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIt does just fine.  What makes you think having more classes hurts performance? Polymorphism is a fundamental part of Java, and that's what the visitor uses to get its job done.  If you're writing Java and avoiding polymorphism because of the performance hit (which is microscopic), you're in the wrong language.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat are the trade-offs of using the Visitor pattern in real-world software engineering?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI don't see any.  I use it when it makes the code cleaner.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eDo you still do an end-of-class get together?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYes, we usually go out to dinner the last week of class.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eOne thing that confused me was a design decision that was made in the VM assignment. The convertToStore method was placed in the LocalLocalOp class instead of outside in the visitor. I would have thought that method were a concern of the visitor and not LoadLocalOp given that the visitor is the class whose logic created the problem. My question this week is why we chose to convert it to store in that location?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThat's because we have more operations coming that will need to be converted to stores.  If we put it in the opcode classes, then we can handle them all in the same way.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eAnother question is where you have used AI thus far in your career?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI haven't used it much, but I use Codeium at work and it saves me some typing occasionally.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat are the best practices for balancing design pattern implementation with system performance, especially in high-load scenarios?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIt seems that I may have given the impression that design patterns hurt performance.  They don't.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

        "text": "Any recommendations on how can I learn to quickly find solutions to problems I am being presented? I am spending hours on the VM, hours on the homework, and hours on the exercises.\n\nPractice is the only way.  One thing I would recommend is what I was saying in class last week - think more up front, and you'll wind up saving time.\n\nHow is heap memory and heap data structure similar, or they completely different animals in computer engineering?\n\nThey're completely different. The naming is just an accident of history.\n\nHowever, I'm still unclear about the complexity analysis for finding nodes below a certain threshold in a min-heap. I understand that the search is O(n), but I would like to understand how this generalizes when implemented on various tree structures. Is there a method or structure that maintains the heap properties but allows a more efficient threshold search?\n\nIf you're going to list all values below a threshold, you can never do better than O(n) no matter how your data is stored, because everything in your data set could be below the threshold.\n\nWill the final exam be comprehensive?\n\nYes, in the sense that I can ask about anything we've covered.  It focuses heavily (around 95%) on the second half of the course, though.\n\nWhat are some other useful data structures are there that are not typically covered in classes?\n\nFibonacci heaps and skip lists are cool.  Tries are pretty useful and rarely covered. Git is a content-addressable object store. There are tons of cool data structures out there.\n\nDo you have any advice on pushing through feeling a bit discouraged when it comes to the computer science field (i.e. feeling stuck, behind, etc)?\n\nThe great majority of you feel this way.  It's the few people that are finding things a little easier that make the most noise.  Don't worry about that - if you keep practicing, you can get there.\n\nHow do you know if something should be in its own Thread?  Do multiple Threads run at the same time when using the Thread class in java?\n\nThe short answer is yes.  Lots more info here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/procthread.html\n\nDoes it also use a Heap and run one thread at a time but switch threads as needed?\n\nSince today's systems have many cores, more than one thread is actually running at the same time, unlike in the VM.\n\nWhy is the heap structure more efficient than a sorted array for implementing priority queues?\n\nBecause inserting and removing elements in a sorted array involves shifting lots of elements around.  The advantage there is that everything is in order - you can get the 10th largest value, for example.  The disadvantage is that add() and remove() are O(n) instead of O(log n).\n\nWhat confuses me about heap is how can we determine Big O notation. When I was completing extractMin() homework, I had to utilize recursion as well as nested loops. Wouldn't it impact our space and time complexity?\n\nYou have to look at it a little more closely than just saying a loop means O(n).  The loop in extractMin loops over the children of a node, so that loop is really doing a constant number of operations - 2 in a binary heap - it doesn't change as n grows.  The recursion is where the log n comes from - there are log n levels in the heap, so there are log n recursive calls, and each one is doing O(1) work.\n\nWhat kinds of enterprise application uses these kinds of data structures like Visitor pattern, Heap and traversal?  Also, did you have a need to implement any of this in enterprise application?\n\nThey probably all do, someplace in the code.  Maybe it's in a library where the application coder is unaware of it.  I haven't built a lot of enterprise applications, but in Gentran Integration Server, all of these were used.\n\nIf all of the children were the same value, how would we determine which line to go down?\n\nIf the children are all equal, it doesn't matter.\n\nWhat is the most useful book you've read for the field of Computer Science?\n\nI read the Dragon Book on compilers by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman: https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_2/136-7133060-1097609?pd_rd_w=4syUq\u0026content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026pf_rd_r=TSTPM9J5TH9BVJBSRD73\u0026pd_rd_wg=G0Xhh\u0026pd_rd_r=801753c2-b90c-4418-b939-e8a32f84478e\u0026pd_rd_i=0201100886\u0026psc=1\n\nIt was eye-opening.  Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest is great, but I've only read probably 5% of it.  Every time I look at it, it makes me want to create more labs for this course.\n\nI also thought it was helpful to understand how heaps are used for compression. We talked about how these are then used in services such as video streaming services. One question that occurred to me is, how are these used in other ways in the industry?\n\nHeaps are used in many ways.  Priority queues are the most common use.\n\nAlso, you said that compressing data like Netlfix does is very difficult. Why is it so difficult? Does the difficulty come in managing an array and working through that array as a data structure?\n\nMostly I meant that video compression involves a bunch of high-level math.  I know basically how JPEG compression works, and that's hairy enough.  https://cgjennings.ca/articles/jpeg-compression/  I don't know anything about the math involved in video compression, but it must be harder, right?\n\nhow other compression algorithms, like Arithmetic Coding, compare to Huffman coding when it comes to handling dynamic or unknown symbol distributions?\n\nI've never looked at arithmetic coding before.",

Is there a method or structure that maintains the heap properties but allows a more efficient threshold search?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIf you're going to list all values below a threshold, you can never do better than O(n) no matter how your data is stored, because everything in your data set could be below the threshold.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWill the final exam be comprehensive?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYes, in the sense that I can ask about anything we've covered.  It focuses heavily (around 95%) on the second half of the course, though.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat are some other useful data structures are there that are not typically covered in classes?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eFibonacci heaps and skip lists are cool.  Tries are pretty useful and rarely covered. Git is a content-addressable object store. There are tons of cool data structures out there.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eDo you have any advice on pushing through feeling a bit discouraged when it comes to the computer science field (i.e. feeling stuck, behind, etc)?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThe great majority of you feel this way.  It's the few people that are finding things a little easier that make the most noise.  Don't worry about that - if you keep practicing, you can get there.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eHow do you know if something should be in its own Thread?  Do multiple Threads run at the same time when using the Thread class in java?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThe short answer is yes.  Lots more info here: \u003clink href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/procthread.html\"\u003ehttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/procthread.html\u003c/link\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eDoes it also use a Heap and run one thread at a time but switch threads as needed?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eSince today's systems have many cores, more than one thread is actually running at the same time, unlike in the VM.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhy is the heap structure more efficient than a sorted array for implementing priority queues?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eBecause inserting and removing elements in a sorted array involves shifting lots of elements around.  The advantage there is that everything is in order - you can get the 10th largest value, for example.  The disadvantage is that add() and remove() are O(n) instead of O(log n).\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat confuses me about heap is how can we determine Big O notation. When I was completing extractMin() homework, I had to utilize recursion as well as nested loops. Wouldn't it impact our space and time complexity?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYou have to look at it a little more closely than just saying a loop means O(n).  The loop in extractMin loops over the children of a node, so that loop is really doing a constant number of operations - 2 in a binary heap - it doesn't change as n grows.  The recursion is where the log n comes from - there are log n levels in the heap, so there are log n recursive calls, and each one is doing O(1) work.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat kinds of enterprise application uses these kinds of data structures like Visitor pattern, Heap and traversal?  Also, did you have a need to implement any of this in enterprise application?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThey probably all do, someplace in the code.  Maybe it's in a library where the application coder is unaware of it.  I haven't built a lot of enterprise applications, but in Gentran Integration Server, all of these were used.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eIf all of the children were the same value, how would we determine which line to go down?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIf the children are all equal, it doesn't matter.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eWhat is the most useful book you've read for the field of Computer Science?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI read the Dragon Book on compilers by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman: \u003clink href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_2/136-7133060-1097609?pd_rd_w=4syUq\u0026amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026amp;pf_rd_r=TSTPM9J5TH9BVJBSRD73\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=G0Xhh\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=801753c2-b90c-4418-b939-e8a32f84478e\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=0201100886\u0026amp;psc=1\"\u003ehttps://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Alfred-Aho/dp/0201100886/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_2/136-7133060-1097609?pd_rd_w=4syUq\u0026amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c\u0026amp;pf_rd_r=TSTPM9J5TH9BVJBSRD73\u0026amp;pd_rd_wg=G0Xhh\u0026amp;pd_rd_r=801753c2-b90c-4418-b939-e8a32f84478e\u0026amp;pd_rd_i=0201100886\u0026amp;psc=1\u003c/link\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIt was eye-opening.  Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest is great, but I've only read probably 5% of it.  Every time I look at it, it makes me want to create more labs for this course.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eI also thought it was helpful to understand how heaps are used for compression. We talked about how these are then used in services such as video streaming services. One question that occurred to me is, how are these used in other ways in the industry?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eHeaps are used in many ways.  Priority queues are the most common use.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eAlso, you said that compressing data like Netlfix does is very difficult. Why is it so difficult? Does the difficulty come in managing an array and working through that array as a data structure?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eMostly I meant that video compression involves a bunch of high-level math.  I know basically how JPEG compression works, and that's hairy enough.  \u003clink href=\"https://cgjennings.ca/articles/jpeg-compression/\"\u003ehttps://cgjennings.ca/articles/jpeg-compression/\u003c/link\u003e  I don't know anything about the math involved in video compression, but it must be harder, right?\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003ehow other compression algorithms, like Arithmetic Coding, compare to Huffman coding when it comes to handling dynamic or unknown symbol distributions?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI've never looked at arithmetic coding before.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

In those systems, do you think it would have been helpful to have a persistence tool besides a relational database? \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database\n\nHow can these two factors (space and time complexity) be balanced effectively in practical applications of graph algorithms?\n\nIsn't that all you're thinking about when designing a graph algorithm?",

In those systems, do you think it would have been helpful to have a persistence tool besides a relational database?\u003c/bold\u003e \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003clink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database\u003c/link\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eHow can these two factors (space and time complexity) be balanced effectively in practical applications of graph algorithms?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIsn't that all you're thinking about when designing a graph algorithm?\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

        "text": "Can edges have a negative weight?\n\nYes, there are some problems where this makes sense.  You have to be careful, though - some algorithms won't make sense if you have negative weights.  For example, if you have a cycle with a negative total weight, it doesn't make sense to talk about shortest paths - you can go around the cycle many times, and the total cost of your path keeps getting lower.\n\nMy question for this week is, it looks like the github exercises are getting tougher every week. Any suggestions on how to approach them?\n\nNo, not really.  Make sure you understand how all the parts of the previous solution work before starting on the new one, I guess.\n\nWhat is the practical use of these algorithms in dynamic or weighted graphs compared to modern methods like A* or heuristic-based pathfinding?\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is finding all of the shortest paths for a starting vertex.  A* is trying to find a path to a given destination.  They just proved that you can't beat Dijkstra: https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-establish-the-best-way-to-traverse-a-graph-20241025/\n\nIn what specific scenarios might Kruskal’s algorithm outperform Prim’s in constructing minimum spanning trees, particularly for sparse graphs?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.  Do you want me to draw graphs where this is true?  Prim's is better on sparse graphs in general.\n\nWhat is your favorite topic that we cover in this class?\n\nRecursion and Dijkstra's algorithm are my favorites.\n\nMy question for the week is are there any popular libraries that make working with graphs any easier?\n\nProbably :)\n\nDo you have one or two specific strategies or pieces of advice that you’ve found helpful when navigating a large codebase?\n\nI have tunnel vision - I don't worry about things that don't seem related to the problem I'm trying to solve.\n\nWhich is easier to use/ code, Prim's algorithm or Dijkstra’s algorithm in complicated weighted graphs?\n\nThey're both easy to code.  As you saw, the code for each is about a page long.  Making the graphs more complicated doesn't change the code at all, it just makes it harder to do the algorithm by hand.\n\nMy Question for the week is how can we enhance the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to better support the handling of large-scale graphs?  I’ve had scenarios where the JVM crashes when dealing with large data sets.\n\nDo you mean you got an OutOfMemoryError?  You can set a higher max heap size when you start the JVM.\n\nIn the lecture slides, we discussed using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to find minimum spanning trees. Could you elaborate further on which algorithm is more efficient for dense graphs?\n\nIt's Prim's.  What more is there to say?\n\nDo companies that build technology normally give developers time and space to write test suites with good code coverage?\n\nGood ones do.  Lots don't.\n\nMy question for this week is, are languages like Groovy and Scala built in a similar way that we are building our VM assignment? Do they create opcodes also? Could we continue this lesson and it end up being as useful as those JVM based languages?\n\nEverything that runs on the JVM creates class files that use the same bytecode.  The opcodes we're using are very similar to the real JVM.  The real ones are here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html\n\nSome of what we're doing is exactly like the real thing.  The add opcode, for example: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iadd\n\nThe main thing that's different in our VM is that we only support int.  The real one has to worry about a bunch of different primitive types.\n\nIf we kept going with ours, the next major feature to add is polymorphism.  That wouldn't be any harder than what we've done so far - we have to add syntax for it, each Clazz would have to keep track of its base class, and then when we look for a member variable or method if we don't find it in the current Clazz, we would walk up the inheritance chain looking for it.  Probably that assignment would be easier than adding arrays.  I've thought about working through the next steps and giving them to you as extra material at the end of the course, but haven't gotten around to it.  Ideas I've had:\n\nImplementing operator precedence (order of operations) so that you don't need () everywhere.  You could do x = x + 1 then.\n\nAdding inheritance and polymorphism.  It would be really simple to do this with duck typing, but it wouldn't be that hard to do it Java-style with type checking at runtime.\n\nAdding I/O.  Without a String type this wouldn't be much fun, so maybe add a string type that's built into the runtime, and then make it possible to read input and write output.  There's a bunch of stuff like this that you can add in multiple ways.  If you want to build it in our language, you need to make sure our language has more features so it can be supported - for a string class we would need a char type, and then you have to make that work with lots of the existing opcodes.  It would be simpler to build it into the VM as a special thing.  Then you can kind of cheat to get the functionality without building it in a general way.\n\nOur language is already Turing-complete, so we can do any computation with it that any other language can do.  To get from here to where a real language runtime is would be a HUGE amount of work.  Go read up on how garbage collection works in the JVM sometime.  Or JIT compilation.  Working out how to do either of those could take up a whole career.  For the first time, I mean - copying what the JVM already does wouldn't be THAT hard.\n\nHow do these algorithms (Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's) perform in dense graphs with a large number of edges, and are there specific scenarios in which one algorithm outperforms the others in terms of efficiency or computational complexity?\n\nTheir complexity isn't changed by being run on a dense graph.  Dijkstra's will be O((V+E)log V), whatever E and V are, for example.  As we said in class, Prim's algorithm beats Kruskal's in a dense graph.",

As you saw, the code for each is about a page long.  Making the graphs more complicated doesn't change the code at all, it just makes it harder to do the algorithm by hand.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eMy Question for the week is how can we enhance the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to better support the handling of large-scale graphs?  I’ve had scenarios where the JVM crashes when dealing with large data sets.\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eDo you mean you got an OutOfMemoryError?  You can set a higher max heap size when you start the JVM.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eIn the lecture slides, we discussed using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to find minimum spanning trees.\u003c/bold\u003e \u003cbold\u003eCould you elaborate further on which algorithm is more efficient for dense graphs?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIt's Prim's.  What more is there to say?\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eDo companies that build technology normally give developers time and space to write test suites with good code coverage?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eGood ones do.  Lots don't.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eMy question for this week is, are languages like Groovy and Scala built in a similar way that we are building our VM assignment? Do they create opcodes also? Could we continue this lesson and it end up being as useful as those JVM based languages?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eEverything that runs on the JVM creates class files that use the same bytecode.  The opcodes we're using are very similar to the real JVM.  The real ones are here: \u003clink href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html\"\u003ehttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html\u003c/link\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eSome of what we're doing is exactly like the real thing.  The add opcode, for example: \u003clink href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iadd\"\u003ehttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iadd\u003c/link\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThe main thing that's different in our VM is that we only support int.  The real one has to worry about a bunch of different primitive types.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIf we kept going with ours, the next major feature to add is polymorphism.  That wouldn't be any harder than what we've done so far - we have to add syntax for it, each Clazz would have to keep track of its base class, and then when we look for a member variable or method if we don't find it in the current Clazz, we would walk up the inheritance chain looking for it.  Probably that assignment would be easier than adding arrays.  I've thought about working through the next steps and giving them to you as extra material at the end of the course, but haven't gotten around to it.  Ideas I've had:\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eImplementing operator precedence (order of operations) so that you don't need () everywhere.  You could do x = x + 1 then.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eAdding inheritance and polymorphism.  It would be really simple to do this with duck typing, but it wouldn't be that hard to do it Java-style with type checking at runtime.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eAdding I/O.  Without a String type this wouldn't be much fun, so maybe add a string type that's built into the runtime, and then make it possible to read input and write output.  There's a bunch of stuff like this that you can add in multiple ways.  If you want to build it in our language, you need to make sure our language has more features so it can be supported - for a string class we would need a char type, and then you have to make that work with lots of the existing opcodes.  It would be simpler to build it into the VM as a special thing.  Then you can kind of cheat to get the functionality without building it in a general way.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eOur language is already Turing-complete, so we can do any computation with it that any other language can do.  To get from here to where a real language runtime is would be a HUGE amount of work.  Go read up on how garbage collection works in the JVM sometime.  Or JIT compilation.  Working out how to do either of those could take up a whole career.  For the first time, I mean - copying what the JVM already does wouldn't be THAT hard.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eHow do these algorithms (Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's) perform in dense graphs with a large number of edges, and are there specific scenarios in which one algorithm outperforms the others in terms of efficiency or computational complexity?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eTheir complexity isn't changed by being run on a dense graph.  Dijkstra's will be O((V+E)log V), whatever E and V are, for example.  As we said in class, Prim's algorithm beats Kruskal's in a dense graph.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

        "text": "When starting a quick sort, do you always use the median of the first item, middle item, and last item?\n\nI do.\n\nI ask as I foresee these data points also skewing the true \"center\" of the data?\n\nWhy would that skew the center?  You're more likely to get a value close to the center this way than by choosing a single value.\n\nMy question this week is, can we have a practice set of questions or review for final exam?\n\nThe exercises from each week are a good way to practice.\n\nHow do sequences like 2^k - 1 or n/2, n/4, ... influence runtime?  Are there datasets where one sequence outperforms another significantly?\n\nI don't understand the details of why some gap sequences are better than others in general.  There are datasets for any sorting algorithm that work better or worse for a particular sort.\n\nWhats the best advice you received when you started your career?\n\nI don't remember anyone giving me any, but the biggest lesson I picked up early on was to never give up.  I worked at a startup during college, and the lead developer there would always figure out what was causing a bug.  This was before there was anything useful on the internet, so he had to figure everything out himself, and he always solved the problem.\n\nWhat advantage is there to having type checking done in the compiler vs the method we are currently using?\n\nYou get your errors up front.  With the way we're doing it, you could have errors in the program that you don't find during testing.  It may be that your testing doesn't hit every code path.  With a language like Java, you know you don't have any of those errors when the program compiles.\n\nThis is exactly how things are in JS and Python, for example.  In those languages, you need good test coverage to know you don't have type errors.\n\nI've noticed this course also has a Git related project (compared to our VM project this term). Are there any resources available to view the lesson materials or source code for that project (if we'd like to dive deeper into another project related to the content of this course)?\n\nI would be happy to let you work through that project.  Anyone who wants to work on it can respond to this post with their GitHub username.\n\nHow often do we see tree sort used in industry compared to other O(nlogn) algorithms like quicksort and heap sort?\n\nNever.  I think I've only seen quicksort, mergesort, and insertion sort used in real code.\n\nWhat are the situations where tree sort would be the preferred choice, given its higher space requirement?\n\nThere aren't any.\n\nMy question for the week is how important it is to pick right fit sorting algorithms if the application is not too data heavy and it is running on multiple server?\n\nIf you're trying to sort data that's spread across multiple servers, that's a whole different problem.\n\nHow does AI dynamically determine the most efficient sorting algorithm for any given dataset, especially when the dataset characteristics (e.g., size, range, and distribution) are unknown?\n\nYou don't need AI for this.  Timsort, which is the method Java uses for Collections.sort() takes different strategies depending on the characteristics of the data.  If the data is very small, it uses insertion sort.  If it's bigger, it uses quicksort (or maybe mergesort, I don't remember).  If it's really big, it does some sampling of the data to decide what approach to use.  You can read the source from the Collections class - it's pretty interesting.\n\nHow did you get into teaching computer science?\n\nI did my Master's thesis on a compiler I had written on the job.  After I defended it, one of the professors asked if I would be interested in teaching the compilers course at Case.  I was excited about it, and then it fell through because of low enrollment.  I moved to Columbus shortly after that, and then Franklin had an ad in the paper.\n\nMy question for this week is what feature of garbage collection makes it so complicated?  Is it knowing what to garbage collect?\n\nWhen I said this could take a whole career, I meant figuring out the best way to do it - garbage collection has gotten a lot better over the last 30 years.  It was always correct - it collected the right objects - but now it interferes with the running application much less than it used to.  Implementing it the way the JVM does it wouldn't be that hard, but it was too big for a weekly assignment.\n\nYou can read about the details here: https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html\n\nOne thing I am still unclear about is how the constant factors in the O(n log n) algorithms, like quick sort or heap sort, impact real-world performance, especially with very large datasets?  Do these algorithms always scale better in practice, or are there edge cases where simpler algorithms like insertion sort might still be preferable?\n\nConstants are important, and you can see their impact in the graphs from last week's slides.  They're the reason for the differences between the sorts that have the same O().  This is why there's a big difference between bubble and insertion sort, and why tree sort is so terrible compared to quicksort.  Constants can sometimes be more important that O(), even.  Shellsort's O() is worse than tree sort, but you can see that n is going to have to be very large before tree sort will be faster in absolute terms.",

        "text": "How often have you encountered these tree balancing algorithms in the real world, and what are some of the common use cases for them?\n\nWhen faced with dynamic data streams in fields like financial systems or gaming engines, how do developers decide between using AVL and Red-Black trees?\n\nIs it more common to use red-black trees or AVL trees?\n\nIt doesn't matter much, but TreeSet and TreeMap in the JDK are red-black trees.\n\nWhat are some real-world scenarios where AVL trees and Red-Black trees are used? \n\nAny time you want to keep the elements of a set or map ordered.\n\nOne aspect I’m still unclear about is how to identify the \"critical\" node during AVL tree balancing in nested cases, like RL or LR?\n\nThe root of the unbalanced tree is the one with +2 or -2 balance factor.\n\nI wonder whether modern applications, particularly hybrid data structures, can combine the benefits of both AVL and Red-Black trees for optimized performance?\n\nAre there hybrid approaches that leverage the benefits of both structures?\n\nDon't they have the same benefit?\n\nIn the industry, what are some initial signs that you are working for a good company? \n\nThey make you write code in the interview.  One thing I look for is that they get rid of people who aren't productive/are personally unpleasant.  If a company never fires anyone, over time they wind up with mostly engineers that can't get a job anywhere else - the good ones that have other opportunities leave. The company culture is one of the most important things to me now - my last two jobs have had no jerks, no political stuff to worry about, and no fighting to take credit for things.  It's SO NICE not to have to worry about that and just focus on building the best products.\n\nDo you see common implementation of these more advanced data types, or is a small performance hit typically worth a short development time?\n\nAre you implying that a custom implementation would be more efficient?  Balanced trees are never going to be the slowest things in your application, so trying to make them more efficient would be a waste of effort.  Programmers are terrible at guessing what's going to be slow.  The only way to really create fast code is to measure, make changes, and measure again.  You'll be surprised where the time is spent.\n\nWhile implementing Red-Black Tree in a project, how can we define whether the node is Black or Red? Is there any qualifier that does it?\n\nPut a boolean call isRed in your Node class.\n\nWhat makes us consider rotating the ancestor nodes before the parent and grandparent of the inserted node?\n\nIf the current node, parent, and grandparent are not in a straight line, you need to do a preliminary rotation on the parent to get them lined up.\n\nHow can we improve the process of deciding which rotation to use?\n\nIn an AVL tree, you always rotate toward the shorter side of the tree.  In the red-black tree, you always rotate away from the current node (and generally toward the shorter side of the tree).\n\n What is your favorite thing about Java development vs other languages?\n\nType checking is the biggest thing - the compiler catches most of my dumb mistakes.  Otherwise, it would depend on what language I'm comparing to.  Python is pretty great - I think Java's only edge is type checking. Go has several things I don't like - the biggest is the way it doesn't really have inheritance.  TypeScript is pretty good, but it really bugs me that there's no standard equals() method.\n\n 1. Can you point other applications there are for these types of trees, namely AVL or red/black trees? 2. Can explain some other applications in computer science and why these types of trees are so helpful for those problems?\n\nThe answers to these are all the same as when we went over binary search trees.  These trees just stay balanced.\n\nHow does the color-flipping operation in Red-Black trees specifically impact their overall efficiency, and are there any scenarios where Red-Black trees might become less efficient than AVL trees?\n\nChanging the color is just setting a boolean, so it doesn't impact efficiency.\n\nRed-black trees are more efficient on insert/delete, and less efficient on search.",
